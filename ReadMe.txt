Hello, just a quick note on how to run the project.

The system was primarily testing using Chrome, so this would be a good browser to explore the system on. However, your browser of preference should work just as well.

When you run the project, entity framework will create the database for you.
You simple have to register a new user on the system.

However, if you have any database connection issues follow the steps below (I don't imagine this will be the case):
1: In the quick launch search bar at in the top right corner of visual studio type "package manager console"
2: In the default project list select the "DataLayer" project
3: In the console type "update-database" and then hit the enter button on the keybaord
Following these steps should create the database for you, remember to register a new user when you initially create the database

If you have any issues, contact me on smccann60@qub.ac.uk
